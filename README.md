FERTILIZER PREDICTION










CS50
This was my final project for conclude the CS50 Introduction to Computer Sciense course.

FEATURES








i have use  python for FERTILIZER DETECTION OR PREDICTION..






EXPLANING THE PROJECT AND THE DATABASE







my project totaly based on farming ,right now farmer are not useing the proper fertilizer for farming and some people also forced to farmer to use the bad fertilizer for farming .TODAY FARMER ARE IN VERY MUCH TROUBLE DUE TO HELPLESSNESS AND THEY ARE USE WRONG FERTILIZER FOR THEIR CROP AND THEY ARE FACING A HUGE LOSS SO I HAVE TO DO THIS. THIS PROJECT WILL HELP FARMER IN RIGHT DIRECTION AND FARMER ALSO BENIFICIAL WITH THIS PROJECT. WHEN THE FARMER ENTER TEMPARATURE, HUMIDITY,MOISTURE ,SOIL_TYPE, AND CROP_TYPE THEN THE PROJECT SAY THE FERTILIZER WITH 98% ACCURACY.THE FARMER ARE MORE EDUCATED IN FARMING GROUND AFTER USING THIS.
